# PickyRobotics

Picky Robotics was a side project to tele-operate a robotic arm mounted on top of an AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle). The targeted use cases were to restock products in retail store on the shelves, and pick up products for e-commerce orders. The final output of the project can be seen in this video:
